<h1>A Brief History of the Chinese Language</h1>

<p>So you want to learn Chinese, spoken by roughly 15% of the world population and gaining prominence rapidly. 
  With over 3,000 years of written history, the language has changed dramatically and formed several dialects, 
  some of which could be considered mutually unintelligible even with the state sponsored programs to standardize 
  the language. </p>

<h2>Old and Middle Chinese</h2>

  The first written records of the Chinese language are seen on oracle bones about 3,000 years ago during the 
  Shang dynasty (商朝). Later, during the Western Zhou period, numerous examples can be seen on bronze artifacts 
  and the Five Classics (五經). Some reconstructions of Old Chinese have suggested it might have been an atonal 
  language, relying on terminal consonant clusters that later developed into tones in Middle Chinese.<br><br>

  During the Northern and Southern dynasties (南北朝) of the 6th to 10th centuries, Middle Chinese developed and 
  flourished, but coexisted in several dialects.</p>

<h2>Northern Dialects and Standardization</h2>

  In the 13th century, Mongols conquered the Song and created the Yuan dynasty (元朝). The Mandarin dialects 
  quickly gained importance and were used by officials as a common language. By the 19th century, the Beijing 
  dialect became the de facto language of the imperial court and was essential for business.<br>

  Around 1930, China adopted a standardized language based on Mandarin known as guoyu 国语. Vietnam, Korea, and 
  Japan have also been influenced by Chinese characters and pronunciation, which has led to it having comparable 
  status in those languages as Latin and Greek prefixes and suffixes have in English.</p>
