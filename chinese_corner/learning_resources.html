						Mango Languages is currently my favorite general language app. With real speakers, 
						interactive script (Chinese characters with pinyin on hover), and lessons presented 
						as conversation that is built upon previous vocabulary, this app is a great resource 
						for learning. There are roughly 500 lessons, as well as some supplementary Mandarin 
						courses discussing fengshui and the Chinese zodiac. I assume this program is typically 
						expensive, but you can access it through almost any local library for free (make an
						account for the online resources at your library and sign in).

					<strong>Great for Listening</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						Pimsleur is an older program that is 100% audio, which makes it great for commutes
						or times when you want to let your eyes rest. Unlike many apps that simply “teach”
						vocabulary, Pimsleur lessons are presented as a conversation that builds upon
						previous vocabulary in 150 30-minute daily sessions. While the program can be fairly
						expensive, you can usually find the audio CDs at the library and in some cases, even
						the app offered through the online resources.<br><br>

						Note: I would suggest using this only after you have a strong understanding of the
						tones and sounds possible in Mandarin and as a supplement.

					<strong>Great for Writing, Reading</strong>

				<div>
					<p>
						While definitely not my first choice as a language learning app, 
						the idea of gamified learning provides some with a powerful incentive.
						The one key advantage of this program is that you can get some typing 
						practice and multiple answers are accepted (typically for typing
						practice, your answer has to be exactly the same, even though there 
						are multiple ways to write a given sentence). Furthermore, Duolingo is
						crowdsourced, so when you aren’t sure about an answer, you can usually 
						find a good explanation in the comments for that question.<br><br> 

						<strong>Note:</strong> While there is audio, it is computerized and 
						should only be used as a supplement.

					<strong>Great for Reading, Listening</strong> 
				</div>

					<p>
						This is one of my favorite reading apps. It presents short stories in the form of Manga, with pictures, 
						interactive dialogue (click for pronunciation and tips), and grammar lessons as you are learning. Stories 
						are ordered by HSK level (starting with HSK 0, i.e. absolute beginner), and range a variety of genera, 
						such as action, mystery, horror, romance, etc. This app is semi-free – you can get more “beans” (their 
						currency) by answering questions of the day in Chinese, completing tests, inviting friends, or paying.<br><br>

						<strong>Note:</strong> The audio is natural, but often a bit fast and full of colloquialisms, so it will help 
						you learn “real” Chinese (i.e. what you will hear when you will visit).

						Not a very flashy app, but I have found it well organized and great for learning how to read 
						in Chinese. Many words in Chinese consist of two characters, and it isn’t always obvious how 
						words with the same characters are related. In this app, not only can you see the meaning of 
						a word (often two characters), you can also see the meaning of the individual characters. For 
						me, this has been extremely useful for thinking about the characters and how they have combined.
