                    Mango Languages is currently my favorite general language app. With real speakers, 
                    interactive script (Chinese characters with pinyin on hover), and lessons presented 
                    as conversation that is built upon previous vocabulary, this app is a great resource 
                    for learning. There are roughly 500 lessons, as well as some supplementary Mandarin 
                    courses discussing fengshui and the Chinese zodiac. I assume this program is typically 
                    expensive, but you can access it through almost any local library for free (make an
                    account for the online resources at your library and sign in).<br><br>

            <div style="font-size:1.1em;">
            	Pimsleur is an older program that is 100% audio, which makes it great for commutes
                or times when you want to let your eyes rest. Unlike many apps that simply “teach”
                vocabulary, Pimsleur lessons are presented as a conversation that builds upon
                previous vocabulary in 150 30-minute daily sessions. While the program can be fairly
                expensive, you can usually find the audio CDs at the library and in some cases, even
                the app offered through the online resources.<br><br>
                
                Note: I would suggest using this only after you have a strong understanding of the
                tones and sounds possible in Mandarin and as a supplement.<br><br>
