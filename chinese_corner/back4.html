		Welcome to Chinese corner and you are the brave one to take a step further in your Chinese learning journey.

		and practices, learning resources etc and feel free to leave us a message. All questions are equal here in 
		Tralinge and we will try our best to provide help.<br><br>

		Our latest project is to learn Chinese through telling, listening to, and making up stories so that we 
		can tap into the deep processing of our brain and make meanings of Chinese through contexts, pictures 
		and sounds. Click <a href="https://www.tralinge.com/chinese_corner/stories">here</a> for the latest 
		stories and email us if you would like to be part of the project.<br><br>
