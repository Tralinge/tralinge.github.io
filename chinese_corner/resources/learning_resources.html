		No single resource is ever enough, find which areas you are struggling with and target them with a
		variety of resources. There are many great resources available, but we have focused on those we feel promote
		the most effective learning. If you feel we left something out, please

							WeChat 微信</a>
					</div>
					<strong>Great for Connecting with Native Speakers</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						WeChat is the most popular chatting app among Chinese speakers. When you travel to China, 
						don't be surprised if random people you meet immediately want to add you to their WeChat
						contacts. The app has several functions such as video chat, group chat, posting pictures, etc.<br><br>
						
						<strong>Note:</strong> Be careful what you post on WeChat, the government of China has 
						access to everything you post, so try not to use it when criticizing anything Chinese.
						As with any social media, think before you post and you shouldn't have any problems.

							Mango Languages</a>
					</div>
					<strong>Great for Listening, Reading</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						Mango Languages is currently my favorite general language app. With real speakers, 
						interactive script (Chinese characters with pinyin on hover), and lessons presented 
						as conversation that is built upon previous vocabulary, this app is a great resource 
						for learning. There are roughly 500 lessons, as well as some supplementary Mandarin 
						courses discussing fengshui and the Chinese zodiac. I assume this program is typically 
						expensive, but you can access it through almost any local library for free (make an
						account for the online resources at your library and sign in).

							Pimsleur</a>
					</div>
					<strong>Great for Listening</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						Pimsleur is an older program that is 100% audio, which makes it great for commutes
						or times when you want to let your eyes rest. Unlike many apps that simply “teach”
						vocabulary, Pimsleur lessons are presented as a conversation that builds upon
						previous vocabulary over 150 30-minute daily sessions. While the program can be fairly
						expensive, you can usually find the audio CDs at the library and in some cases, even
						the app offered through the online resources.<br><br>

						<strong>Note:</strong> I would suggest using Pimsleur only after you have a strong 
						understanding of the tones and sounds possible in Mandarin.

					</div>
					<strong>Great for Writing, Reading</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						While definitely not my first choice as a language learning app, 
						the idea of gamified learning provides some with a powerful incentive.
						The one key advantage of this program is that you can get some typing 
						practice where multiple answers are accepted (in most other apps with typing
						practice, your answer must be exactly the same, even though there 
						are multiple ways to write a given sentence). Furthermore, Duolingo is
						crowdsourced, so when you aren’t sure about an answer, you can usually 
						find a good explanation in the comments for that question.<br><br> 

						<strong>Note:</strong> While there is audio, it is computerized and 
						should only be used as a supplement.

							Manga Mandarin</a>
					</div>
					<strong>Great for Reading, Listening</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						This is one of my favorite reading apps. It presents short stories in the form of manga, with pictures, 
						interactive dialogue (click for pronunciation and tips), and grammar lessons as you are learning. Stories 
						are ordered by HSK level (starting with HSK 0, i.e. absolute beginner), and span a variety of genera 
						such as adventure, mystery, horror, romance, etc. This app is semi-free – you can get more “beans” (their 
						currency) by answering questions of the day in Chinese, completing tests, inviting friends, or paying.<br><br>

						<strong>Note:</strong> The audio is natural, but often a bit fast and full of colloquialisms; it will help 
						you learn “real” Chinese (i.e. what you will hear when you will visit).

					<strong>Great for Reading</strong> 
				</div>

				<div>
					<p>
						Not a very flashy app, but I have found it well organized and great for learning how to read 
						in Chinese. Many words in Chinese consist of two characters, and it isn’t always obvious how 
						words with the same characters are related. In this app, not only can you see the meaning of 
						a word (often two characters), you can also see the meaning of the individual characters. For 
						me, this has been extremely useful for thinking about the characters, how they have been 
						combined, and guessing the meaning of new combinations of those characters. Translations are
						in dictionary form, which allows you to see all the possible definitions and pronunciations 
						of each character (yes, some characters are shared for multiple seemingly unrelated words).
