	<p>
    	
        Even for the seasoned traveler, China can be a bit difficult to navigate. 
        While there are plenty of services available, they are not always accessible 
        if you, like most tourists, fall into any of these three categories:
        
        <ul>
        	<li>No Chinese government issued ID
            <li>No Chinese bank (often requires Chinese ID card)
            <li>Limited ability to read Chinese characters
        </ul>        
        
        In addition, many of the apps such as Facebook and Google are banned in 
        China, which will make them difficult to use without a VPN. There are 
        tourist apps that will help you with this, but they often charge fees 
        such as $5/ticket to help you book train tickets. In short, getting around
        China is extremely easy – if you are Chinese. Furthermore, while the great
        majority of Chinese will likely be extremely friendly towards you, they may
        not always be able to help you as they don’t have the same problems (e.g.
        booking tickets) as you will (everything is so easy for them, so they will
        often assume you are just having difficulties because of the language barrier).<br><br>
        The good news – if you paid attention in your Chinese class and can read
        Chinese fairly well, many apps (e.g. WeChat and Alipay) are considered 
        “super apps”, meaning you can accomplish several tasks from one application. 
        
        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        The first thing you probably need to do after arriving in China is to get 
        to your accommodation to sleep off some jet-lag. Think you will just whip 
        out Google Maps? Think again - Google is banned in China and as such, there 
        is limited data (even with a VPN, it may not be that helpful). The alternative
        – <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baidu.BaiduMap&hl=en_US">
        Baidu Maps</a>.<br><br>
        
        Not that good at reading and typing in Chinese? You may want
        to try an offline alternative such as 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&hl=en_US">Maps.Me</a>
        , where you don’t even need an internet connection after you have downloaded
        the area maps.<br><br>
        
        With a metro line direct from any major airport, an app like 
        <a href=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xinlukou.metroman&hl=en_US”>Metro China Subway</a> 
        could be extremely useful as it has pinyin to help you navigate the metro
        systems of China.<br><br>
        
        If you prefer splurging on a taxi, 
        <a href=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sdu.didi.psnger&hl=en_US”>DiDi</a> 
        is the Chinese equivalent of Uber/Lyft. See those lovely, extremely useful, 
        and cheap bike rentals all over the city? You may have to look at several apps
        to find one that doesn’t require Chinese Identification (a task that might
        require some Chinese friends to help you).<br><br>

        <h2>Communication</h2>
        While we noted that Google doesn’t work in China, there are some exceptions –
        <a href”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate&hl=en_US”>Google Translate</a> 
        seems to work decently, especially if you have downloaded the offline language
        packages. While traveling around China, don’t be surprised if random people want 
        to add you to their WeChat list of contacts.<br><br>
         
        <a href”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.mm&hl=en_US”>WeChat</a> 
        (known as 微信 [wei1 xin4] in Chinese) is a “super app” that will help you
        stay in touch with all of your Chinese contacts. It also supports many other
        functions, such as payments, but without a Chinese issued ID card and/or
        Chinese bank, this may not work for you. As with any social media, be careful
        what you say and post. As a super app, you can also pay for things using
        WeChat, but good luck trying to add any money on without a Chinese bank.<br><br> 
        
        If need to keep in contact with the outside world via WhatsApp, Facebook,
        Gmail, or any other banned app, you should seriously consider a VPN. There 
        is a huge list of VPNs that changes quickly, and while they all do essentially
        the same thing, some work better than others in China. The list of good VPNs
        changes quickly, so it may be better to do a quick search online to get the
        most up-to-date information. Keep in mind, you will need to install the VPN
        prior to getting to China as they are often blocked within. Also, the Apple 
        App Store, for whatever reason, has many more restrictions on apps, meaning 
        it may be difficult to find some VPNs if you have Apple products.<br><br>  
        <apps>
        
        <h2>Pay</h2>
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eg.android.AlipayGphone&hl=en_US”>Alipay</a>
        , a “super app”, will likely be one of the most useful payment options in
        China, where many people rely on a cashless system. It is a bit difficult to
        get started, but it is possible without even being Chinese! Essentially, you
        can’t add money from your bank, but other people can add money to your account,
        which is where friends and services like 
        <a href=”https://theswapsy.com/”>Swapsy</a> can exchange your money for RMB.
        Alipay also will help you with a range of other tasks such as directly booking
        train tickets (without the fees), splitting bills at a restaurant, renting
        bikes, etc. and it has a decent amount of English (it still has many errors 
        and often a mix of Chinese), which may help you feel more at ease about where
        your money is going and what you are agreeing to.<br><br>
         
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ctrip.android.view&hl=en_US">Ctrip</a> 
        can also be used for discounts, but it is only in Chinese, so seriously
        consider studying your Chinese well - it can save you a lot of money.<br><br>
        
        <a href=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taobao.taobao&hl=en_US”>Taobao</a>
        - if you plan on shopping in China, this is the main online app, analogous 
        to Amazon (except you don’t need to make an account). You can purchase
        discounted movie tickets, purchase almost anything you need, etc. It can 
        also be helpful to look up the price of items online, as some stores don’t 
        have prices and the salesclerks will try to sell something at as high a price
        as possible.<br><br>
        
        Meituan (美团) is still a good option. You will be able to enjoy local food 
        at discount prices. It is similar to Groupon but with many options, especially
        in big cities, like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.  Through Meituan, you
        will be able to order take out as well. I am not sure if they have an English
        version though.<br><br>
        
        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        <a href=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.android&hl=en_US”>Airbnb</a> 
        works well for booking accommodation, and can be used without Chinese (although
        you might need to need some Chinese to interact with your host and get
        directions). This is a nice choice as you can often find decent home
        accommodations for $20/night or under, sometimes even including breakfast. 
        Keep in mind however, Chinese law requires foreigners to “check in” with the
        local law enforcement in each city. Hotels will do this paperwork
        automatically, Airbnb hosts likely don’t even know it exists. In theory, this
        means you would need to go to the police station to sign some papers each time
        you change cities. In reality, as long as you don’t cause any trouble, you
        won’t have any trouble.<br><br> 
        
        <a href=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.couchsurfing.mobile.android&hl=en_US”>CouchSurfing</a> 
        is another great resource if you are OK sharing a home with someone. Often
        billed as “free accommodation” the reality is that really are expected to
        interact, maybe buy/make at least one meal, and/or go around town with your
        host. This is a great way to meet locals who often don’t get the opportunity 
        to meet foreigners otherwise. Don’t expect luxury accommodations though -
        you’ll likely be sleeping on a sofa, a mat, or some such surface. That being
        said, CouchSurfers are some of the coolest people we have met.
