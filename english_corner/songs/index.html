		<h2>Learn Through Songs!</h2>
		<p>
			Sometimes we get tired and just want to listen to some music. When you listen to songs, you don’t just hear the words, you hear the rhythm, the sounds, and the emotion behind them. Listening alone is not enough to learn a language, but if you actively think about the words and their meanings, you’ll find you have made a much deeper understanding of the language and culture. Furthermore, singing the words can help you with pronunciation and help you become more confident speaking.
