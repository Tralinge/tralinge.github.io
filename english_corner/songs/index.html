		<h2>Learn Through Songs!</h2>
    	<p>
            Sometimes we get tired of trying so hard, we just want to listen to some music – 
            what better way to relax? When you listen to songs, you don’t just hear the words, 
            you hear the rhythm, the sounds, and the emotion behind them. You start connecting 
            with the culture and the people, not just the language. Songs typically are colloquial, 
            spoken in every day language, and filled with repeating sections that will remain in 
            your head, popping back up at various points throughout the day. Listening alone is 
            not enough to learn the language, but if you actively think about the words and their 
            meanings, you’ll find you have made a much deeper connection with the language and its 
            culture. Do you love to sing? Singing the words can help you with pronunciation and help 
            you become more confident in a language.
