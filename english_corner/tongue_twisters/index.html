		<h2>Betty Botter</h2>
		<p>
            Betty Botter bought some butter
            But she said the butter’s bitter
            If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter
            But a bit of better butter will make my batter better
            So ‘twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter

		<h2>Woodchuck</h2>  
		<pre>
            How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
            He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, and chuck as much wood
            As a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood

		<h2>Tree Toad</h2>  
		<pre>
            A tree toad loved a she-toad, who lived up in a tree.
            He was a three-toed tree toad, but a two-toed toad was she.
            The three-toed tree toad tried to win, the two-toed she-toad's heart,
            For the three-toed tree toad loved the ground, that the two-toed tree toad trod.
            But the three-toed tree toad tried in vain. He couldn't please her whim.
            From her tree toad bower, with her two-toed power, the she-toad vetoed him.
