		<h2>Difficulties</h2>  
		<p>
			<strong>Pronunciation</strong><br>
			One of the most difficult parts of learning English is the crazy pronunciation, which is
			often ambiguous and confusing. English has been heavily influenced by several languages 
			over its evolution, leading to a very diverse set of rules for pronunciation. You 
			can read more about the history of English 
			<a href="https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/history_of_english">here</a>.<br><br>
			
			For more advanced speakers, you can practice tongue twisters 
			<a href="https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/tongue_twisters">here</a>. These are 
			difficult even for native speakers, and good for practice before a speech.<br><br>
			
			<strong>Etymology – Study of the Origin of Words</strong><br>
			As noted in the <a href="https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/history_of_english">
			History of the English Language</a>, English is derived from several languages. 
			If you spend a little time learning some of the roots of these other languages, 
			many of the seemingly complicated, high-level words in English will suddenly start 
			to seem very reasonable and easy to remember, now that you have made the connection. 
			With a little bit of practice, you will be surprised how many new words you will 
			understand without even using a dictionary. Finally, once you realize the 
			interrelatedness of languages you will find you are well on your way to becoming 
			a polyglot! Learn some word roots
