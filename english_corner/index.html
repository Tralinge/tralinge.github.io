			<strong>Pronunciation</strong><br>
			One of the most difficult parts of learning to speak English well is the seeming lack of 
			phonetic spelling. In many languages, there are very specific rules regarding spelling 
			and pronunciation, the rules in English however are often ambiguous and confusing. 
			English has been heavily influenced by several languages over the course of its evolution, 
			which has led to the incorporation of a very diverse set of rules for pronunciation. You 
			can read more about the history of English

			<strong>Etymology – Study of the Origin of Words</strong>
			As noted in the <a href="https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/history_of_english">
			History of the English Language</a>, English is derived from several languages. 
			If you spend a little time learning some of the roots of these other languages, 
			many of the seemingly complicated, high-level words in English will suddenly start 
			to seem very reasonable and easy to remember, now that you have made the connection. 
			With a little bit of practice, you will be surprised how many new words you will 
			understand without even using a dictionary. Finally, once you realize the 
			interrelatedness of languages you will find you are well on your way to becoming 
			a polyglot! Learn some word roots
