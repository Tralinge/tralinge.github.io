				Old English developed from Germanic dialects brought to Britain by the Anglo-Saxons
				as Roman rule of the island dwindled. The Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons quickly
				became the dominant language, replacing Latin (brought by the Romans) and Celtic languages.<br><br> 

				Several dialects of Old English emerged, but the West Saxon dialect grew to prominence 
				with the rise of the kingdom of Wessex and became the standard for writing. During that 
				period, writing shifted from runic script to Latin script. Old English is much more similar 
				to German than Modern English. Here is an example from Beowulf:

				"Listen! We of the Spear-Danes<br> 
				from days of yore have heard of<br> 
				the glory of the folk-kings..."

				The 8th and 9th centuries saw waves of Norse colonization, causing Old English to be heavily
				influenced by Old Norse (a Northern Germanic Language), especially in the north.<br><br> 

				In 1066, William the Conqueror invaded England and became the first Norman King of England. 
				This led Old English to be heavily influenced by Old Norman (a Romance language related to 
				French) as it was the language of the elites. Many words for politics and prestige are therefore 
				closely related to French. During this period, English became more simplified and rigid, likely 
				due to different systems of grammar. Here is an example from the Canterbury Tales:

				Weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow<br>
				I know enough, in the evening and in the morning,'<br>
				said the Merchant, 'and so do many others<br>
				who have been married.

	<h2>Early Modern English</h2>

				style="max-width: 400px;">">In the 15th century, led by King Henry V, English started overtaking Norman French in prestige 
				and was used in many official documents in Chancery Standard. Around the same time, the printing press 
				was introduced to England, thereby increasing the prominence of Chancery Standard. Important works 
				from that period include Shakespeare’s works and the King James bible.

	<h2>Proliferation of Modern English</h2>

				In the 18th century, Modern English spread through conquest by the British Empire and emerged as the 
				de facto language of commerce, diplomacy, science, education, etc. Following independence of many of 
				the former British colonies, several different dialects emerged through contact with local languages. 
				With the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century and proliferation of mass media, 
				English became a truly global language, used more widely than any other language.
