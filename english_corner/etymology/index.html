<h1>English Etymology</h1>

<h2>Latin and Greek</h2>
<p>Two very important languages in English are Latin and Greek, especially if you are in a scientific field. 
    So why do we use these two languages so extensively? They donâ€™t change! They are what we consider dead 
    languages. Note that the Greek I am talking about is not the modern form of Greek spoken in Greece today 
    in the same way that Spanish or French are not Latin. Because these languages are no longer in use, the 
    form can be preserved and therefore used across many languages with slight changes in pronunciation, but 
    nearly universal understanding, especially in written form. Learn about Latin and Greek roots
