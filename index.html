	<h1>Tralinge - A Site Dedicated to Langauge Acquisition</h1>
	<p> This site pulls together the knowledge of over a decade of combined teaching
		experience at multiple levels of intensity (casual to university level)
		and several age groups from infant to adult. This site is still under 
		development, so please be patient while we learn to code and add more 
		material. In the mean time, feel free to browse the different pages here.
		Currently the site is divided into Chinese and English, with more languages
		in the future.<br>

		<p> For my English learners, please note the <a href="https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/worksheets.html">
			"Worksheets"</a> section where you can find several useful exercises.

			My current project is to make short phonics books to help English learners
			practice differentiating between diagraphs (e.g. ch/sh, sk/sc, pr/pl) in an
			amusing way. Be sure to check out these short stories <a href="
