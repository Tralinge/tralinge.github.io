	<h1>Christopher - 林风</h1>

	    <p>Hello!<br>
	    For those of you that don't already know me, my name is Christopher. I come from the heart
	    of the United States and have several years of teaching experience in various subjects 
	    (English, Spanish, science, math, etc.) as well as several years of experience working in
	    microbiology and chemistry. I have a wide variety of interests, but above all, love being
	    outdoors and traveling. I am currently developing this website along with my collegues with
	    the goal of creating a reference for teachers and students alike to learn language not 
	    mearly through vocabulary, but through culture, thereby offering a more holistic (and hopefully
	    more enjoyable) approach to learning langauges. While you are busy learning a foreign language,
	    I am filling my free time learning to code in order to provide you with a more interactive site.
	    There is still a long way to go, so please bear with me.
