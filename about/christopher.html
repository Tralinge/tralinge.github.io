		Hello, I'm Christopher!<br>
		I'm a teacher from the United States with over 6 years of experience teaching various subjects 
		such as English, Spanish, science, and math. Prior to teaching, I worked in microbiology and chemistry 
		labs, but found my true love is teaching - whether you are 3 years old or 100, I'm sure we can learn
		from each other. I have a wide variety of interests, but above all, love traveling and learning languages, 
		which allows me to engage my students and help them by focusing on their language-specific mistakes.
