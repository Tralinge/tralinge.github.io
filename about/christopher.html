		Hello, I'm Christopher!<br>
		I'm a teacher from the United States with <b>over 6 years of experience teaching</b> various subjects 
		such as English, Spanish, science, and math. Prior to teaching, I worked in microbiology and chemistry 
		labs, but found my true love is teaching - whether you are 3 years old or 100, I'm sure we can learn
		from each other. I have a wide variety of interests, but above all, love traveling and learning languages, 
		which allows me to engage my students and help them by <b>focusing on their language-specific mistakes</b>.
		I can adapt my teaching style to match your level and needs to give you a unique experience, whether you are 
		interested in learning English, science, or just need some help preparing for an exam or an interview.
		If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <b><a href="mailto: tralinge@gmail.com">tralinge@gmail.com</a></b> 
		or book a lesson by clicking on the icons that say “book now” and I will get in touch with you.
