		Hello!<br>
		For those of you that don't already know me, my name is Christopher. I come from the heart
		of the United States and have several years of teaching experience in various subjects 
		(English, Spanish, science, math, etc.) as well as several years of experience working in
		microbiology and chemistry. I have a wide variety of interests, but above all, love being
		outdoors and traveling. I am currently developing this website along with my colleagues with
		the goal of creating a reference for teachers and students alike to learn language not 
		merely through vocabulary, but through culture, thereby offering a more holistic (and hopefully
		more enjoyable) approach to learning languages. While you are busy learning a foreign language,
		I am filling my free time learning to code in order to provide you with a more interactive site.
		There is still a long way to go, so please bear with me.
