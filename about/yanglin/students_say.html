        <em>“Wonderful instructor, great at teaching both materials related to class and also cultural 
        exposure. I enjoyed the little jokes and pop culture references thrown into class. I like 
        the sense of humor, fashion choices, and bits of personal story that Professor Lu shares 
        with us.”</em> - Ella

        <em>“She was very helpful in and outside of class. I have her for individual sessions and really 
        looked forward to understanding the language and the culture of China with her. I appreciate 
        how she gave me a rural perspective of China from her own experiences.”</em> - Kaylin
