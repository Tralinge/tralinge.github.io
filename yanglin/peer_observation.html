            Peer Observation from Bronwyn Stewart<br>
            Chinese 1112<br>
            March 8th, 2019<br>
            Van Allan Hall 161<br><br>

            “Give Directions to the Funny Fish!” These words popped up on Yanglin Lu’s powerpoint, both 
            offering her students a laugh and redirecting their attention back to their objective: giving 
            directions in Chinese. On March 8, 2019, I had the opportunity and pleasure to visit one of 
            Yanglin’s Chinese 1112 classroom, an especially small room that barely accommodates the 16 
            first-year Chinese learners. These students meet five days a week with five different instructors 
            who collaborate to teach different aspects of the language to their students. Yanglin runs the 
            classroom every Friday and her main objective is to test her student’s listening skills, but 
            her efficient use of her 50 minute class period allows her to do so much more than just test 
            and train her student’s listening skills.<br><br>

            Prior to the class, Yanglin and I had met to go over the plan for her class. She walked me 
            through a power point presentation that encompassed listening, writing, and speaking activities 
            as well as music and exciting graphics. She also supplied me with all the materials that she 
            would be giving to her students, an assortment of maps and mazes. On the day of the observation, 
            I arrived at the classroom 10 minutes early and had the chance to linger in the hall with students 
            and listen to their conversations, which primarily revolved around the course and preparing for 
            the oral performance they were to give in the coming minutes. As the previous class filtered out 
            and we were able to enter, Yanglin was not far behind. She greeted her students with a smile and 
            Chinese salutations. Then, she put on Chinese music that would play while students came in and her 
            music choice was the perfect tempo: not too upbeat as to amp up the anxiety of the coming oral 
            presentations, but also not too slow as to make students feel sleepy. This sets the mood for 
            Yanglin’s teaching. She is both casual and comforting, but also extremely efficient and firm in 
            her expectations.<br><br>

            While the music plays and students arrive, Yanglin does not waste a moment. She passes out peer 
            review sheets for the oral performances so that her class can begin at exactly 11:30 a.m. with 
            the oral presentations. Though, as she effortlessly navigates the cramped quarters of her classroom 
            she also pauses to answer questions, laugh, and respond to students. It is clear she has a good 
            rapport with her students and, even before class begins, she maintains her standards by responding 
            to all their questions in Chinese. As soon as the clock strikes 11:30, the class begins. She 
            swiftly reminds the students of their prior lessons and then projects the instructions and requirements 
            for the oral presentations. The directions are in Chinese, but the examples are in English. As 
            the students come up to the front, two-by-two, and perform a scene where they are giving directions, 
            Yanglin listens attentively. She nods encouragingly. She thinks about their phrasing. And for every 
            pair, she engages them with questions after their presentation, testing them on alternative ways to 
            say phrases or asking them why they chose certain words over others. These oral presentations become 
            more than a mere memorizing of lines and this is very telling of Yanglin as a teacher, she continuously 
            challenges her students. However, she also uses these moments to instruct. As new information or 
            different phrases are used, she takes the opportunity to write these on the board for her students.<br><br>

            After they finished the oral presentations, Yanglin engaged her students in a writing activity. In 
            our meeting, prior to the observation, Yanglin mentioned that students had been complaining about not 
            writing every class, which is why she was making an effort to meet these needs by including a short 
            five-minute writing activity. This desire to write more was confirmed when I listened to her students 
            in the hall. What really struck me about Yanglin’s class was how she transformed this writing activity 
            into something more active. It was not the mere, flippant oh yeah, they want to write so we’ll let them 
            write for five minutes that I expected from our meeting. No, Yanglin transformed their writing practice 
            by inviting four students to write their responses on the board. She had four willing volunteers who came 
            to the board and collaboratively helped each other form their responses and fix their Chinese character, 
            while Yanglin walked around the class to assure that all her students are participating and to aid them 
            whenever she can. After all the students at the board have finished, Yanglin returns to the front and 
            walks her class through an evaluation of the responses. The most amazing part of this activity was than 
            Yanglin was not the one correcting, she asked the right leading questions to prompt her students to 
            correct their own mistakes. This activity exemplifies a few aspects of Yanglin’s teaching. First, her 
            ability to transform a simple writing activity into an opportunity for collaborative learning shows her 
            ingenuity as an instructor. Next, the manner in which she coaxes students into evaluating and correcting 
            her own work shows that she is student oriented. And finally, the fact that her students were comfortable 
            volunteering and were able to laugh at their own mistakes as they made corrections is a testament to the 
            environment that Yanglin fosters in her classroom.<br><br>

            Next, her students were given maps and their listening skills were tested as an audio file was used to 
            give directions that the students had to draw on the map. Yanglin prefaced the assignment by explaining 
            one word that may be unfamiliar: one way. Then, after seeing the collective confusion, she assured her 
            students that the map was difficult, especially if you did not listen carefully to the first statement. 
            As she finished playing the audio file, one of the students sitting near me let out an “Oh!” and there 
            was a nodding consensus that this time the audio made more sense. Yanglin let her students compare their 
            results and then, after exploring the classroom and guiding students through their maps, she played the 
            audio file one final time. This time she played it one phrase at a time, allowing her students to yell 
            out how that would translate onto the map. These activities left little time for giving directions to 
            the “funny fish,” but with just over five minutes left in the class period, the sheer comedy of the slide 
            was able to distract students from the clock and helped draw them into the maze Yanglin provided with 
            several fish that needed to reach their destination, but did not know directions. Of course, in only 
            five minutes, students did not have time to finish this task, but what struck me was that not a single 
            student began packing their bags until two minutes after the class’s designated end time. This speaks to 
            Yanglin’s ability to keep students engaged and entertained by her activities as well as her sense of humor.<br><br>

            Throughout the class I observed, I was struck by two aspects that are key to Yanglin’s teaching and success 
            as an instructor. First, as I have mentioned, Yanglin is very efficient with her time. In just 50 minutes, 
            she was able to move her students through four activities that engaged different facets of the language 
            learning process – speaking, writing, and listening. There was never an awkward pause as Yanglin seamlessly 
            moves from one activity to the next. The second is the environment. Every one of the students in that class 
            felt comfortable to speak and raise their hand. Yanglin continually engages them in Chinese, responding to 
            their questions in both English and Chinese, encouraging them through examples to use and practice the 
            language. But further, Yanglin’s willingness to cater to individuals or pairs as they practice their language 
            skill reinforces her interest in each student’s success.
