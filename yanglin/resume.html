            	Full-time graduate student pursuing MA in Teaching Chinese as a Second Language. My TAship allows me to teach Chinese to undergraduate students. I design my own lesson plan, work with other team teachers and grade students' work.<br><br> 

I would like to build a solid foundation of pedagogies and second language acquisition theories. I adopt a constructivism world view that we can make thing happen by our effort. I aim to be a teacher-researcher and constantly reflect on my teaching and learning to better assist my students.
