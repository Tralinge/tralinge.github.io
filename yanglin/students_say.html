                <div style="font-style:italic; font-size:1.1em; text-align:justify;">“Wonderful instructor, great 
                    at teaching both materials <strong>related to class</strong> and also <strong>cultural exposure
                    </strong>. I enjoyed the <strong>little jokes </strong>and <strong>pop culture references
                    </strong> thrown into class. I like the sense of <strong>humor, fashion</strong> choices, 
                    and bits of personal story that Professor Lu shares with us.”<br><br>

                <div style="font-style:italic; font-size:1.1em; text-align:justify;">"<i>你好！</i>I was wondering 
                    if I could reschedule my individual session to a different time today, maybe even <strong>
                    a time that is not on your list if possible.</strong> Now I have a time conflict. Are you 
                    available at any time between 1:30 and 3:30 on Thursday? <strong>I would like to keep my 
                    individual section with you if possible! </strong>谢谢你"</i>

                    “She was very <strong>helpful in and outside </strong>of class. I have her for individual 
                    sessions and really looked forward to understanding <strong>the language and the culture</strong> 
                    of China with her. I appreciate how she gave me a <strong>rural perspective</strong> of China from 
                    her own experiences.”<br><br>

                    us! You were a very <strong>funny, helpful </strong>teacher!"<br><br>
                </div>

                <div style="font-style:italic; font-size:1.1em; text-align:justify;">"I like that you 
                    have <strong>music </strong>at the beginning of the class. I read the lyrics and try to understand what 
                    it says."<br><br>

                <div style="font-style:italic; font-size:1.1em; text-align:justify;">"I like 
                    the <strong>videos of other Chinese Speakers</strong>. I think it is important to hear many different 
                    people speak the language. But the instructions of worksheet sometimes could be <strong>confusing</strong>."
