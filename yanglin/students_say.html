        <div style="font-style:italic; font-size:1.2em; text-align:justify;">“Wonderful instructor, great 
            at teaching both materials <strong>related to class</strong> and also <strong>cultural exposure
            </strong>. I enjoyed the <strong>little jokes </strong>and <strong>pop culture references
            </strong> thrown into class. I like the sense of <strong>humor, fashion</strong> choices, 
            and bits of personal story that Professor Lu shares with us.”<br><br>
        </div>

        <div style="text-align:justify; font-family:sans-serif; font-size:1.1em;">"<i>你好！</i>I was wondering 
            if I could reschedule my individual session to a different time today, maybe even <strong>
            a time that is not on your list if possible.</strong> Now I have a time conflict. Are you 
            available at any time between 1:30 and 3:30 on Thursday? <strong>I would like to keep my 
            individual section with you if possible! </strong>谢谢你"</i>

            “She was very <strong>helpful in and outside </strong>of class. I have her for individual 
            sessions and really looked forward to understanding <strong>the language and the culture</strong> 
            of China with her. I appreciate how she gave me a <strong>rural perspective</strong> of China from 
            her own experiences.”<br><br>

        <div style="font-size:1.1em; font-family:monospace; font-style:italic;">"Thank you for teaching 
            us! You were a very <strong>funny, helpful </strong>teacher!"<br><br>

        <div style="font-size:1.2em; font-family:sans-serif; font-style:italic;">"I like that you 
            have <strong>music </strong>at the beginning of the class. I read the lyrics and try to understand what 
            it says."<br><br>
        </div>

        <div style="font-size:1.1em; text-align:justify; font-style:italic; font-family:cursive;">"I like 
            the <strong>videos of other Chinese Speakers</strong>. I think it is important to hear many different 
            people speak the language. But the instructions of worksheet sometimes could be <strong>confusing</strong>."
