				This Friday is like any of the others, my teaching day.<br><br> 

				My students and I were doing the usual things, oral performance in Chinese, listening exercises, 
				cultural notes, and writing in Chinese characters, a new practice. I invited a few students to write 
				on the blackboard.<br><br> 

				The writing for today is to copy the question " 你把作业放在哪里了？（Where do you put your homework? 
				with a unique sentence pattern "把“”）" and write their own response to it. It was during this process 
				that my students used the power of writing to put me in a trash can. The evidence is in the picture. 
				One student responded, "我（I）把 老师（teacher）放在（put in）trash can 了。” Yeah, he indeed borrowed 
				"trash can" from English to complete his thought.<br><br> 

				The funny thing was he did not realize he accidentally "put the teacher in a trash can" until I led 
				the whole class to read his brilliant response. He thought “老师teacher” is “作业homework” according to him.<br><br>

				Yes, we all laughed hard and had a great time.

				This Friday is like any of the others, my teaching day, hooray!<br><br> 

				I did not expect in the next 50 minutes, anything crazy was going to happen to me until after the 
				"student put me in a trash can" incident. I was on the floor with tears in my eyes when I was attempting 
				to read the text the students were going to work on. It was right after the 3rd line 医生给她什么什么了一下。
				My students have magic power when they imitating me and another instructor to say 什么什么, literally "what what" 
				and functionally like "blah blah" in English. Picture yourself teaching English and they are filling the blanks 
				with blah blah. I do not know if it has any power over you. When the whole class was "什么什么“ with me, I was 
				laughing too much that I could not stand on my feet and I cried, or at least I burst into tears. I recovered 
				soon though, so I was able to continue the whole orchestra.<br><br> 

				When the class was over, one student came and told me today's class was fun and another was waving goodbye 
				smirking.<br><br>

				<br>The funny thing is the students also have learnt the new expression bla bla to death， verb+死了（dead). 
				In my case, 我笑死了。<br><br>

				I laugh to death, I laugh hard）.
