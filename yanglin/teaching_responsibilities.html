        <h1>Teaching Responsibilities</h1>

        <div style="clear:both; text-align: justify;">
            I work with a team of dedicated Chinese teachers to offer Chinese language courses to undergraduate 
            students at the University of Iowa. In this unique model, 5 teachers work in a team with different 
            emphases on, such as vocabulary, speaking, grammar and listening throughout the week.  We all share 
            the same pedagogical goal- to help students to master Mandarin. We work collaboratively as well as 
            independently. We often meet to reflect on and improve our teaching in our weekly meetings. Each week, 
            I work on the lesson plan with a focus on listening and I teach 4 sections independently. Additionally, 
            I am also responsible for student's grading, etc. Each semester, I also assist in the Chinese corner 
            and cultural celebrations in our department.<br><br> 

            Team Teacher with a focus on speaking skills.<br><br>

            In general, Chinese 1111 does not require students to have previous experience of Mandarin Chinese. 
            In this semester students will learn Pinyin which helps students to read the characters in the future, 
            most frequent radicals of Chinese characters and basic conversations. My main role is to help students 
            to develop their speaking skills by using the language in a context.<br><br>

                <li>Coach students on Chinese performance during Mid-autumn Festival Celebration (Chinese department organized 
                and provide students opportunities to use what they have learned).

                <li>Co-host Chinese corner where Chinese learners get extra time to practice their Chinese and learn more about 
                Chinese culture.

                <li>Offer one-on-one sessions with students on a weekly basis to work on speaking, reading, writing or listening 
                depending on the students.

            Team Teacher with a focus on listening skills.

            Students in Chinese 1112 often have previously studied some Chinese and have a good grasp on Pinyin and radicals. 
            They continue to develop their knowledge of radicals and move from basic conversations to other topics which are 
            relevant to students, such as, eating at a restaurant, shopping, celebrating the birthday, etc. They are expected 
            to learn more complicated sentence structure. As their listening instructor, I often use authentic materials to 
            design class activities to engage students. For example, students are offered a hand-drawn map and they are 
            instructed to listen to the audio and mark the route and means of transportation of me going to China from Iowa 
            City. I also use body language, pictures, etc to make my Chinese comprehensible to students.<br><br>
