					Building a multi-language learning website.<br><br>

                My colleague Chris and I (mostly him)  have been working on our site Tralinge 川林哥 since 
                January 2019. He has been learning to create the website from scratch. We envision that we 
                will provide language learning experiences embedded in cultural experiences. It is still a 
                work in progress, but we will eventually get there, to help language learners acquire new 
                skills and develop life long learning skills.

                How to teach Chinese through cultural projects assisted by technology, such as Wechat. WeChat is a very 
                popular app used by Chinese speaking community.<br><br>
                It is a personalized curriculum design based on empirical research and my own teaching experience. I 
                intend to connect my students to native speakers of Chinese and though the projects they can improve not 
                only their language skills but also their cultural competencies and prepare them to be global citizens.

					Writing in a Second Language<br><br>

            <div class="par" style="clear: both;">
                Learning a language is already a challenge, not to mention to write in a second language. However, 
                once equipped with the skill, writing becomes so much fun. I am working on my personal writing in 
                the hope that one day my voice will be heard, and also the voices of people like me. It will be a 
                personal story but goes beyond.

					Translaguaging Stories from Multilingual Speakers<br><br>

                If you happen to speak more than one language, you must have the experience of using words from more 
                than just one languages together to articulate your thoughts or you might use the language structure 
                from one language to create new utterances in another language.<br><br>
 
                It is so fascinating to see and record the beauty of languages.  As a multilingual myself, I often 
                code-switching from my dialect, Mandarin, Spanish to English. In school, our teachers were not speaking 
                Mandarin as they were required to but instead using our shared language, the local dialect. I use 
                Mandarin when I communicate to people not from the little area I am from. And now I am in the US, English 
                is often the language I use to speak to my professors and students. As a Chinese teacher, I often mash 
                Chinese and English together. When I speak to my friends who speak more than one languages, we would mix 
                languages all the time, be it English and Mandarin, English, Mandarin and Spanish. It has become part of 
                me to draw different language resources.
