        Teaching Chinese as a Second Language</h2>

        <div style="clear:both; text-align: justify;">
        A language teacher offers more than knowledge about a language. Embedded in language there is culture, power, 
            ideologies, and identities; languages are taught more effectively when I engage my students and empower 
            them with their first languages and cultures. For example, in the week of Halloween, I asked my students 
            how to say Halloween in Chinese and introduced them a few related words; in another week, it was the Day 
            of the Dead and I did something similar. Meanwhile, I would remind them of the Ghost Festival in China 
            that I shared with them before. My students were encouraged to share their culture, traditions while 
            exploring the similarities and differences of the festivals. My students discovered that Chinese prefer to 
            hide at home when ghosts come out while in US, people dress up to party with them. And that detail also 
            reflects the different way of thinking which are channelled through languages. I want to make it clear to 
            my students that they can use Mandarin to open this whole new world and realize their own dreams. <br><br><br>

        三人行，必有我师。Confucius believed that walking with two other people, they might serve as his teachers because 
            others always have something to offer. Students also bring their unique profile to the classroom, such as 
            their home language and culture. Each of us can learn from one another, not just students from teachers. I 
            am very honest with my students when I learn something from them. For example, at times I might ask my students 
            how to say certain things in English or what measurements they use for pant sizes. They laughed when I thanked 
            them for teaching me something new. Meanwhile, I hope they understand in that space, we can learn from each 
            other and they are contributing members to the class.<br><br><br> 

        One plus one is more than two. That motivates me to create a learning community. In one group activity, my students 
            worked together to listen to an audio about how I go home from the US. I gave them a hand-drawing map and 
            instructed them to figure out my route and what kind of transportation I used for each trip. I was happy to see 
            my students were negotiating meaning with one another and sometimes they had to persuade the other student that 
            I took a train, Huoche from Shanghai to Hefei, not a plane, Feiji. In the end, I asked the different groups to 
            report the details of each trip. Even though there were disagreements, they learned from each other. To connect 
            my students with native speakers, I initiate the WeChat (a Chinese instant messenger) Project in which I will 
            connect my students with native speakers of various backgrounds and assignment them questions on a weekly basis. 
            My goal is to provide them ample opportunities to use Mandarin, to gain confidence in speaking the new language, 
            and to foster a cultural competence.<br><br><br>

        I try to create such a space where students have an optimal experience of learning Mandarin through group work, 
            multimedia, music, crafts, projects and telecommunication with native speakers, etc. It is my routine to play 
            Chinese music or videos before each class which intrigued my students and they often come to me asking questions 
            about the music piece or the content of the video. I like this transformation from that teachers tell students what 
            they should know that students want to know. Let their curiosity to be the teacher.<br><br><br> 

        The combination of teachers and students is like chemistry, each one has its own property to be discovered. With the 
            right condition, it sparkles. It is an ongoing process to know myself and to know my students. I have noticed, the 
            more I know my students, the more comfortable and understanding we become with one another. After teaching for one 
            semester and working with some of the students one-on-one, I felt more confident when I started teaching this semester 
            because I knew the majority of them. The moment I entered the space, I knew I belonged there. They greeted me and told 
            me they miss me. I was almost burst into tears. Another time they told me they love me after I thanked them for 
            motivating me to be a better teacher on Valentine’s Day. And I want my students to have the same belonging as I did. 
            But that is not the end, I listen to what other teachers, read the latest research, experiment at my class. I take 
            every possible chance to get to know my students better, such as when grading their homework, exchanging emails, meeting 
            them at different events and advising their cultural performances during Mid-autumn Festival and Chinese New Year Celebrations.
