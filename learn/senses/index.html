		Many have asked us, "What is the best way to learn a language?" 
		The answer we typically give them – immersion, at which point the smile fades from their faces. It’s a little 
        disheartening seeing how some people give up so easily when they find something difficult; rather than making
        a plan to achieve, or at least approximate, what they perceive to be “impossible”. Instead, they resign 
        themselves to do nothing or continue with their previous methods. Obviously not everyone can go to another 
        country and immerse themselves in the language, but that doesn’t preclude them from faking it. Which brings 
        me to the current topic – Faking Immersion.<br><br> 

        So what is immersion anyway? Imagine being immersed in a pool of grape juice – the longer you are there, the 
        more difficult it is to distinguish you from the grape juice. First, you’ll start smelling and tasting like 
        grape juice; soak for a bit longer and you will even start to be the same color; stay too long, you’ll become 
        the grape juice itself (not suggested)!<br><br> 

        When learning a language, you can approximate immersion by using as many of your senses as possible. Seeing and 
        hearing the language are probably obvious, buy you might raise your eyebrows at the thought of feeling, tasting, 
        and smelling a language. What many people forget is that languages are cultural entities – if you try to separate 
        the language from the culture, too much will be lost in the translation. What better way to understand culture than 
        by tasting the food, smelling the vegetation, and feeling the music and terrain over which the language has developed 
        and flourished? Over the next few writing segments, I’ll explain how you can do this. Stay tuned!
