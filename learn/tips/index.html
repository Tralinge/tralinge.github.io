        TOP TIP: Change your learning environment!<br>
        Your brain works on connections and associations, which is why you may find that it is easier for you to remember 
        something when you move to a different environment (e.g. park, classroom, swimming pool). Many students 
        study a language in a classroom or from the comfort of their homes, which is fine if that is where you plan 
        on using the language, but not as effective when you are traveling to new and exotic places. Try practicing 
        words when you are on the go, at a restaurant, or any other situation. Learning in a classroom is far too 
        methodical, scaffolded, and predictable for you to learn all the little nuances of a language. This is a 
        part of the reason why some people find it difficult to speak in a real situation even though they know all 
        the necessary vocabulary.

        TOP TIP: Focus on understanding general concepts!<br>
        When you don’t understand one word in your native language, do you go OCD, focusing on that one word that you
        didn’t understand, or do you think about the context and form assumptions about its meaning? Ideally, you are 
        in the second group and should use the same method when learning a language. This is one of the methods children
        employ which enables them to quickly learn large quantities of words. Think about it – when you were learning your 
        first languages, did your parents read you dictionary definitions? I hope not. So why are you? When reading 
        especially, read for the general concepts. Each time you encounter a word, you will get an idea about the meaning, 
        further refining your own definition each time. It’s no fun to read with a dictionary – it breaks up the story and 
        makes us lose interest. Consider a child – the first time a girl sees a cat, the mother will tell her “cat”, the 
        girl will repeat, and form certain conclusions about what a cat is, perhaps assuming that cats are furry creatures 
        that walk on four legs, have pointy ears, and a long tail. The next day, the child sees a dog, and calls it a “cat” 
        – the mother corrects her daughter, simply telling her “dog”. Now the child starts thinking about how the two animals 
        are different, thereby refining both her definition of “dog”, and that of “cat”. With more time and more examples, 
        the girl’s definition becomes both more refined and expanded to something similar to your definition of “cat”.

        TOP TIP: Be brave!<br>
        One reason children can often learn faster is because they are braver than adults. Most young children seem to lack 
        some of the basic instincts for survival – they’ll walk right up to a tiger or into the ocean. Curiosity is one of 
        the best teachers and most adults seem to be lacking in that field – some have just stopped asking questions altogether.
        Do you know why the sky appears blue? Most children aren’t overly concerned if they make an error when speaking, which
        is why they can experiment with the language and learn from their mistakes. Adults, on the other hand, often focus 
        grammar and learning set phrases rather than experimentation. They often lack the confidence, which inhibits their 
        ability to “feel” the language. It isn’t your first language, you will make mistakes, it’s not a big deal. I would be 
        willing to bet you can learn far more from your mistakes than from a grammar book. Be brave, learn from your mistakes,
        and move on – it will make you a better language learner and a more resilient person in general.
