		<strong>TIP: Read more!</strong><br>
		When we say read, we’re not talking about grammar books – they aren’t a very effective way for most
		learners because they are boring! You can get a highly intuitive sense of grammar just by reading for 
		fun! Books typically use higher level words and better grammar than speaking, which makes them an 
		important resource.<br><br>  

		Go to the library and pick out about ten books that you are interested in reading. Read the first page 
		of each book. If you can understand about 80-90% of the words, keep the book. If you understand 100%, 
		the book is probably too easy – get rid of it. If you understand less than 80%, the book is too difficult 
		– maybe you can read it later. If you can’t find any for your level, you may need to look in the adolescent 
		section or even the child section.<br><br> 

		After you have found at least one book for yourself, you can start your reading adventure! Reading will 
		help you expand your vocabulary very efficiently by learning through context. You don’t need to know every 
		single word you read – each time you see that new word, you will start creating your own definition for it, 
		which will get more and more accurate with time. If you are still confused after seeing a word three times, 
		then you can pull out your dictionary. Using a dictionary too often though brakes up the story and makes it 
		boring, so try to use it sparingly.<br><br> 

		As your reading ability improves, you can try to read some of those more difficult books – you will be 
		surprised how much more you understand.

		<strong>TIP: Watch movies!</strong><br>
		The key to learning is to have fun while you’re doing it. Many people enjoy watching films, so why not try 
		to watch the film in another language? The more you hear the different sounds, the better you’ll get at 
		detecting words. This is not an incredibly effective technique on its’ own, but combined with some study of 
		the language beforehand, and you’ll be surprised how often you start picking out some of the new words you 
		just learned! This not only reinforces your earlier learning, but also gives you context and a better idea 
		of how the word can be used.<br><br> 

		For complete beginners, you may watch with subtitles in your language, but this is extremely ineffective. I 
		would suggest watching the movie with subtitles in the target language – that way, you’ll hear and read the 
		language at the same time. What your ears can’t understand, maybe your eyes can. Once you become higher level, 
		you should try to turn off the subtitles, thereby forcing yourself to listen more. If you miss something, you 
		can always go back, listen again, and maybe turn on the subtitles. This is something of a last resort. Usually 
		you can tell enough just by the body language and the few words you understood. Stopping too often will make 
		this leisurely activity seem like work. You can’t rewind a normal conversation, so it is better to learn how 
		to understand the idea through context as soon as possible.

        <strong>TIP: Change your learning environment!</strong><br>
        Your brain works on connections and associations, which is why you may find that it is easier for you to remember 
        something when you move to a different environment (e.g. park, classroom, swimming pool). Many students 
        study a language in a classroom or from the comfort of their homes, which is fine if that is where you plan 
        on using the language, but not as effective when you are traveling to new and exotic places. Try practicing 
        words when you are on the go, at a restaurant, or any other situation. Learning in a classroom is far too 
        methodical, scaffolded, and predictable for you to learn all the little nuances of a language. This is a 
        part of the reason why some people find it difficult to speak in a real situation even though they know all 
        the necessary vocabulary.

        <strong>TIP: Focus on understanding general concepts!</strong><br>
        When you don’t understand one word in your native language, do you go OCD, focusing on that one word that you
        didn’t understand, or do you think about the context and form assumptions about its meaning? Ideally, you are 
        in the second group and should use the same method when learning a language. This is one of the methods children
        employ which enables them to quickly learn large quantities of words. Think about it – when you were learning your 
        first languages, did your parents read you dictionary definitions? I hope not. So why are you? When reading 
        especially, read for the general concepts. Each time you encounter a word, you will get an idea about the meaning, 
        further refining your own definition each time. It’s no fun to read with a dictionary – it breaks up the story and 
        makes us lose interest. Consider a child – the first time a girl sees a cat, the mother will tell her “cat”, the 
        girl will repeat, and form certain conclusions about what a cat is, perhaps assuming that cats are furry creatures 
        that walk on four legs, have pointy ears, and a long tail. The next day, the child sees a dog, and calls it a “cat” 
        – the mother corrects her daughter, simply telling her “dog”. Now the child starts thinking about how the two animals 
        are different, thereby refining both her definition of “dog”, and that of “cat”. With more time and more examples, 
        the girl’s definition becomes both more refined and expanded to something similar to your definition of “cat”.

		<strong>TIP: Be brave!</strong><br>
        One reason children can often learn faster is because they are braver than adults. Most young children seem to lack 
        some of the basic instincts for survival – they’ll walk right up to a tiger or into the ocean. Curiosity is one of 
        the best teachers and most adults seem to be lacking in that field – some have just stopped asking questions altogether.
        Do you know why the sky appears blue? Most children aren’t overly concerned if they make an error when speaking, which
        is why they can experiment with the language and learn from their mistakes. Adults, on the other hand, often focus 
        grammar and learning set phrases rather than experimentation. They often lack the confidence, which inhibits their 
        ability to “feel” the language. It isn’t your first language, you will make mistakes, it’s not a big deal. I would be 
        willing to bet you can learn far more from your mistakes than from a grammar book. Be brave, learn from your mistakes,
        and move on – it will make you a better language learner and a more resilient person in general.
