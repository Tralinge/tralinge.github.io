		<h2>Faking Immersion</h2>
		<p>
			As an ESL teacher for the last several years, I have met a diverse group of students, from South 
            America to the Middle East and Asia. For me, languages has always been a bit of a passion, which 
            is why I have learned to converse in various languages and at least get my point across even with 
            limited knowledge of a language. After my students learn that I can speak a few different languages 
            they never cease to ask the question “what is the secret to learning languages?” The answer I typically 
            give them – immersion, at which point the smile fades from their face. It’s a little disheartening 
            seeing how some people give up so easily when they find something difficult; rather than making a plan 
            to achieve, or at least approximate, what they perceive to be “impossible”, they instead resign 
            themselves to do nothing or continue with their previous method. Obviously not everyone can go to 
            another country and immerse themselves in the language, but that doesn’t preclude them from faking 
            it. Which brings me to the topic for today – Faking Immersion. <br><br>

                    So what is immersion anyway? Imagine being immersed in a pool of grape juice – the longer 
                    you are there, the more difficult it is to distinguish you from the grape juice. First, you’ll 
                    start smelling and tasting like grape juice; soak for a bit longer and you will even start to 
                    be the same color; stay too long, you’ll become the grape juice (not suggested).<br><br> 

                    When learning a language, you can approximate immersion by using as many of your senses as 
                    possible. Seeing and hearing the language are probably obvious, buy you might raise your eyebrows 
                    at the thought of feeling, tasting, and smelling a language. What many people forget is that 
                    languages are cultural entities – if you try to separate the language from the culture, too much 
                    will be lost in the translation. What better way to understand culture than by tasting the food, 
                    smelling the vegetation, and feeling the music and terrain over which the language has developed 
                    and flourished? Over the next few writing segments, I’ll explain how you can do this. Stay tuned!

                    One way to improve your pronunciation is using phonics to practice similar sounds. 
					To help, we have added a few short stories that you can read and check your pronunciation 
					with the audio. We have tried to make these stories interesting and colorable.

                    For more advanced speakers, you can practice tongue twisters. Tongue twisters 
					help your tongue get used to moving in different ways more efficiently and enhance 
					your enunciation. Don’t worry if you find them difficult - even native speakers have 
					a hard time.

					English is derived from several languages. If you spend a little time learning some 
					of the roots of these other languages, high-level words in English will become
					very easy to remember. With a little bit of practice, you will be surprised how many 
					new words you will understand without even using a dictionary. Finally, once you realize the 
					interrelatedness of languages you will find you are well on your way to becoming 
					a polyglot!
