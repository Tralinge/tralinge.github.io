title: "New Diagraph Stories and Website Updates"

It's been awhile since my last post. I've been working hard on the site, making it more 
responsive to other forms of technology, not just a laptop. I was making several worksheets
for learning vocabulary and giving practice on certain items, but many of these things can
already be found elsewhere. What is unique about Tralinge is the cultural component. For
that reason, I want to add more stories, which will not only allow students to practice 
the language, but will also have cultural aspects ingrained. The concept is still a work in 
progress, so right now I'm working on shorter stories to help students with pronunciation.
I have published a few stories now utilizing diagraphs. You can find them here: https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/worksheets/phonics.html I plan on getting the comments 
section up shortly so that you can give feedback. Enjoy for now!
