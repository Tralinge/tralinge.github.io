While there haven't been any posts recently, rest assured, we've been working hard to create more content as well as improve the 
visual appeal of the site. There are a few new song additions, along with audio to help you practice singing along; you can find
them in the ["song section"](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/songs/) 

After hearing your feedback, I have changed focus on the story section to help younger learners who are overwhelmed by more than
one page of content. Check out this new type of ["short story worksheet"](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/stories/shorts/dungbun)
and be sure to leave feedback.
