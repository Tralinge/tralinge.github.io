Good news! We are back from vacation and producing content once again! I have just finished 
["Snape the Snotty Snake"](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/stories/snape/) -
a phonics story to practice the digraphs sn/sm. In addition, I have added a section called 
[tongue twisters](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/tongue_twisters) for the more 
advanced students. I hope you enjoy! Be sure to leave a comment.
