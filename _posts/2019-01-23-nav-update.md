I spent quite some time on the navigation bar today and not sure I like it :p 
The focus was on making the nav sticky, which was harder to incorporate than I
thought. For now, I have added padding on the sides, but I think I might need
to make it into columns later. I think that is enough for now; I will start 
adding more content now and working more on a plan. Styling is mostly done
minus some tweeks.
