I have added a new ["song section"](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/songs/) for those 
who have expressed an interest in learning through songs. 
This will offer a more enjoyable way of learning for some. I hope to start moving into making
videos and sound recordings as well, to help students practice at a slightly slower tempo, 
focusing on pronunciation prior to speeding up to normal karaoke speed. Most of the interest
is in Disney songs, so the first few songs will be from Tangled, Moana, and Frozen. In the future,
I plan on adding simpler songs for my younger students. Let me know if you have a song request
or request for a different type of song (e.g. nursery rhymes, pop music, etc.).

I've been working hard on the website and completing all my other tasks. I have just finished 
["Cal the Caring Cow"](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/stories/cal/) -
a phonics story to practice the soft and hard "c" sounds. In addition, I have been trying to 
clean up the site a bit in order to make it look a tad more professional, as well as adding 
quite a bit to the about section, especially the Yanglin page. I hope to be producing more content
soon and reevaluate the direction of the site. I hope you enjoy! Be sure to leave a comment.
