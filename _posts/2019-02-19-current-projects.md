It's been awhile since my last post. I've been working hard on the website and would like to share
my plans. There is still a lot to do before the website looks more professional, but these are my
current focus:

1. Finish layout, styling, etc., maybe add some color.
2. Add content - focus on stories.
3. Add sound clips for stories.
4. Bring in more collaborators.
5. Add a comments section (in addition to the one on the news page).

I was working on a section called "etymology" that discusses the origin of words and how you can 
understand many higher level words without a dictionary. For the time being however, I think I'll 
focus on the stories as I feel they would be in the highest demand and most unique. Other sections
about learning English will be completed in the future if there is demand for it. Make sure you 
leave your comments (click on the heading to view the news article by itself; then you'll see a 
comment section at the bottom.

Thank you for your patience. I hope to get more cultural content out soon. 加油！
