I have added several updates to the site now, including (but not limited to): 
navigation icons instead of underlined links, font stylization, heading changes, etc.
Switching back and forth between HTML and CSS has be a bit confusing, but I think
I'm getting the hang of it. I played around with backgrounds, but I think I agree that 
it seems to look better without so much extra junk to distract the reader. I have noticed
that most professional websites don't even bother with background images and tend to focus
on the solid colors close to black or white. There is still a whole list of things I have
yet to figure out, but I think I made a lot of progress today. I'm waiting for tomorrow to
see whether one of my initial goals for this site - worksheets for English teachers, is 
going to pan out. I may be losing one of my biggest customers. Maybe I could do worksheets
by demand, but I don't know if it is really worth the time. I am interested in teaching 
via song though. That would mostly be video, but I can redirect viewers here to see the
lyrics.
