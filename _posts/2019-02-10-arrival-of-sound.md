I have been making several phonics stories for English learners to practice their reading and
pronunciation and realized, it would be much more helpful with some sound. Therefore, I am 
currently recording the stories and embedding them into the story pages. The first one is done 
- [Grace the Great Grizzly](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/stories/grace.html). I 
noticed that the stories page was getting a bit crowded, so I moved each story to it's own 
page. Once I learn a bit more Java, I hope to make something a bit more interactive, where you
can flip the page, but I'll probably need to color the pages as well (currently they are black
and white so that you can color them while you read). Enjoy and be sure to comment if there 
is something you would like to see on this site. Have fun!
