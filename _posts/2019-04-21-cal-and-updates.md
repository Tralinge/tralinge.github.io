I've been working hard on the website and completing all my other tasks. I have just finished 
["Cal the Caring Cow"](https://www.tralinge.com/english_corner/stories/cal/) -
a phonics story to practice the soft and hard "c" sounds. In addition, I have been trying to 
clean up the site a bit in order to make it look a tad more professional, as well as adding 
quite a bit to the about section, especially the Yanglin page. I hope to be producing more content
soon and reevaluate the direction of the site. I hope you enjoy! Be sure to leave a comment.
