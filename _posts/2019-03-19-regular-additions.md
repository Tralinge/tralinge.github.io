I have made most of the adjustments to the website that I want for now; 
there are some minor fixes, but that can be improved later when traffic increases.
For now, the focus will continue to be on creating content for the site on a regular 
basis. For that reason, my goals are to:

- make at least one story each week (along with the flipbook and audio)
- make at least one worksheet each week
- start the creation of embedded video
- attract at least 2 new visitors/week
