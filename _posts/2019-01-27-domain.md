I acquired the domain and I think I set it up correctly. Unfortunately I don't know yet... it might take some time for 
it to be fully published. GitHub thinks it is published and Google seems to think it is there. Now it is just a question
of whether I messed something up or it just takes time to fully publish. This part was much more complicated that I 
would have thought, and there was a lot of talk about using the dig command, but I'm not sure how to do that. If the 
site is not published by tomorrow, I will look into that more.
