We will be traveling for a couple weeks, so there won't be any updates. When we come back,
we plan on doing a makeover for the website to make it look a bit more professional and 
see what other content we can add. I have done several phonics stories now, so I would like
to start adding slightly higher level stories for more advanced learners and content more 
focused on other topics such as travel, food, etc. If you have any interests/requests, be
sure to leave a comment or contact us [here](https://www.tralinge.com/contact).
